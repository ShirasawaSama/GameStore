Hello! I'm excited to introduce you to my Full Stack Application Development project called 'GameStore.' In this project, I've designed a web application using MongoDB, Flask API, Angular and docker.

This project is already published in GitHub with AGPL license.
 
And can be very easily deployed through Docker.

Let's start with the homepage. It features a dynamic display of six randomly recommended games, along with relevant information and gameplay videos. At the top, there's a search bar that allows users to search for games. Users can also choose specific tags to perform individual searches. The bottom of the webpage includes pagination and the option to choose the number of items displayed per page.

To enhance user experience, I've implemented sorting functionality. Users can select sorting fields and the desired sorting order from the options on the left side of the bottom section. This way, they can easily find the games they're interested in.

Clicking on any game card will redirect users to a detailed game introduction page. Here, they can find comprehensive information about the game, including comments from other users. Users can leave their own comments and support others' comments by giving them a heart symbol. The number of likes received by each comment is displayed.

At the top of the webpage, users will find their profile picture. By clicking on it, they can register, log in, or recover their password. Once logged in, users can bookmark their favorite games and view them in their personal profile page. They also have the option to remove games from their collection.

To summarize, GameStore is a comprehensive web application that provides a seamless gaming experience. It offers a user-friendly interface with random game recommendations, search functionality, sorting options, detailed game pages with user comments, and personalized profiles.

I'm confident that the GameStore project demonstrates my skills in Full Stack Application Development, and it has been an exciting journey to bring this project to life. Thank you for watching, and I appreciate your time and consideration in evaluating my course performance. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out. Thank you!
